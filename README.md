---Automaton simulator---

Uses a definition to create an automaton and an input sequence to simulate the behaviour of the defined automaton.
Prints out a console line output that describes events happening during the simulation.

###Currently only the pushdown automaton is implemented.

Pushdown automaton:

run with: python simulator.py -test 1
(while positioned in the root directory of this project)

- there are 25 test cases that can be run

- to run a test case use: python simulator.py -test X,
	where X is the number of the test case you want to run

- to run all test cases use : python simulator --all
